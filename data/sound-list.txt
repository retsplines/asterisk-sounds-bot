data/asterisk-core-sounds-en-wav-current/demo-abouttotry.wav en  I am about to attempt an Inter-Asterisk Exchange connection to a demonstration server located at Digium.

data/asterisk-core-sounds-en-wav-current/demo-congrats.wav en  Congratulations.  You have successfully installed and executed the Asterisk open source PBX.  You have also installed a set of sample sounds and configuration files that should help you to get started.  Like a normal PBX you will navigate this demonstration by dialing digits.  If you are using a console channel driver instead of a real phone you can use the dial, answer, and hang up commands to simulate the actions of a standard telephone.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en-wav-current/demo-echodone.wav en  The echo test has been completed.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en-wav-current/demo-echotest.wav en  You are about to enter an echo test.  In this mode everything you say will be repeated back to you just as soon as it is received.  The purpose of this test is to give you an audible sense of the latency between you and the machine that is running the echo test application.  You may end the test by hanging up or by pressing the pound key.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en-wav-current/demo-enterkeywords.wav en  Please enter one or more keywords separated by * and then press the pound key.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en-wav-current/demo-instruct.wav en  If you would like to learn more technical information about Asterisk dial 2 now.  If you'd like to test out the voice over IP capabilities of Asterisk you can dial 500 to attempt an Inter-Asterisk Exchange or IAX connection to a demonstration server at Digium.  In order for this test to work you will need to be connected to the Internet and have at least a 28.8 kilobit modem.  To execute an echo test dial 600.  This test is most useful when you have connected to this Asterisk server from a remote location.  The sample configuration also has a single user with extension 1234 and password 4242.  That user is configured to ring the console when their extension is dialed.  If you dial 1234 you can try to ring the console.  If the console is busy or unavailable you will be given the option to leave voicemail.  To check voice mail for the user dial extension 8500 to enter the voicemail system.  Finally,  you can press the pound key to disconnect from the PBX.

data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_GB-wav-current/demo-abouttotry.wav en_GB  I am about to attempt an Inter-Asterisk Exchange connection to a demonstration server located at Digium.  In order for this to work you must already be connected to the Internet.  Please wait a moment while I attempt to make the connection.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_GB-wav-current/demo-congrats.wav en_GB  Congratulations.  You have successfully installed and executed the Asterisk open source PBX.  You have also installed a set of sample sounds and configuration files that should help you to get started.  Like a normal PBX you will navigate this demonstration by dialing digits.  If you are using a console channel driver instead of a real phone you can use the dial, answer, and hang up commands to simulate the actions of a standard telephone.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_GB-wav-current/demo-echodone.wav en_GB  The echo test has been completed.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_GB-wav-current/demo-echotest.wav en_GB  You are about to enter an echo test.  In this mode everything you say will be repeated back to you just as soon as it is received.  The purpose of this test is to give you an audible sense of the latency between you and the machine that is running the echo test application.  You may end the test by hanging up or by pressing the pound key.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_GB-wav-current/demo-enterkeywords.wav en_GB  Please enter one or more keywords separated by * and then press the pound key.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_GB-wav-current/demo-instruct.wav en_GB  If you would like to learn more technical information about Asterisk dial 2 now.  If you'd like to test out the voice over IP capabilities of Asterisk you can dial 500 to attempt an Inter-Asterisk Exchange or IAX connection to a demonstration server at Digium.  In order for this test to work you will need to be connected to the Internet and have at least a 28.8 kilobit modem.  To execute an echo test dial 600.  This test is most useful when you have connected to this Asterisk server from a remote location.  The sample configuration also has a single user with extension 1234 and password 4242.  That user is configured to ring the console when their extension is dialed.  If you dial 1234 you can try to ring the console.  If the console is busy or unavailable you will be given the option to leave voicemail.  To check voice mail for the user dial extension 8500 to enter the voicemail system.  Finally,  you can press the pound key to disconnect from the PBX.

data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_AU-wav-current/demo-abouttotry.wav en_AU  I am about to attempt an Inter-Asterisk Exchange connection to a demonstration server located at Digium.  In order for this to work you must already be connected to the Internet.  Please wait a moment while I attempt to make the connection.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_AU-wav-current/demo-congrats.wav en_AU  Congratulations.  You have successfully installed and executed the Asterisk open source PBX.  You have also installed a set of sample sounds and configuration files that should help you to get started.  Like a normal PBX you will navigate this demonstration by dialing digits.  If you are using a console channel driver instead of a real phone you can use the dial, answer, and hang up commands to simulate the actions of a standard telephone.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_AU-wav-current/demo-echodone.wav en_AU  The echo test has been completed.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_AU-wav-current/demo-echotest.wav en_AU  You are about to enter an echo test.  In this mode everything you say will be repeated back to you just as soon as it is received.  The purpose of this test is to give you an audible sense of the latency between you and the machine that is running the echo test application.  You may end the test by hanging up or by pressing the hash key.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_AU-wav-current/demo-enterkeywords.wav en_AU  Please enter one or more keywords separated by the star key and then press the hash key.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_AU-wav-current/demo-instruct.wav en_AU  If you would like to learn more technical information about Asterisk dial 2 now.  If you'd like to test out the voice over IP capabilities of Asterisk you can dial 500 to attempt an Inter-Asterisk Exchange or IAX connection to a demonstration server at Digium.  In order for this test to work you will need to be connected to the Internet and have at least a 28.8 kilobit modem.  To execute an echo test dial 600.  This test is most useful when you have connected to this Asterisk server from a remote location.  The sample configuration also has a single user with extension 1234 and password 4242.  That user is configured to ring the console when their extension is dialed.  If you dial 1234 you can try to ring the console.  If the console is busy or unavailable you will be given the option to leave voicemail.  To check voice mail for the user dial extension 8500 to enter the voicemail system.  Finally,  you can press the hash key to disconnect from the PBX.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_AU-wav-current/demo-moreinfo.wav en_AU  Asterisk is an Open Source full-featured PBX and IVR platform that runs on the linux operating system.  For more information, visit www.asterisk.org.

data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_NZ-wav-current/demo-abouttotry.wav en_NZ  I am about to attempt an Inter-Asterisk Exchange connection to a demonstration server located at Digium.  In order for this to work you must already be connected to the Internet.  Please wait a moment while I attempt to make the connection.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_NZ-wav-current/demo-congrats.wav en_NZ  Congratulations.  You have successfully installed and executed the Asterisk open source PBX.  You have also installed a set of sample sounds and configuration files that should help you to get started.  Like a normal PBX you will navigate this demonstration by dialing digits.  If you are using a console channel driver instead of a real phone you can use the dial, answer, and hang up commands to simulate the actions of a standard telephone.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_NZ-wav-current/demo-echodone.wav en_NZ  The echo test has been completed.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_NZ-wav-current/demo-echotest.wav en_NZ  You are about to enter an echo test.  In this mode everything you say will be repeated back to you just as soon as it is received.  The purpose of this test is to give you an audible sense of the latency between you and the machine that is running the echo test application.  You may end the test by hanging up or by pressing the pound key.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_NZ-wav-current/demo-enterkeywords.wav en_NZ  Please enter one or more keywords separated by * and then press the pound key.
data/asterisk-core-sounds-en_NZ-wav-current/demo-instruct.wav en_NZ  If you would like to learn more technical information about Asterisk dial 2 now.  If you'd like to test out the voice over IP capabilities of Asterisk you can dial 500 to attempt an Inter-Asterisk Exchange or IAX connection to a demonstration server at Digium.  In order for this test to work you will need to be connected to the Internet and have at least a 28.8 kilobit modem.  To execute an echo test dial 600.  This test is most useful when you have connected to this Asterisk server from a remote location.  The sample configuration also has a single user with extension 1234 and password 4242.  That user is configured to ring the console when their extension is dialed.  If you dial 1234 you can try to ring the console.  If the console is busy or unavailable you will be given the option to leave voicemail.  To check voice mail for the user dial extension 8500 to enter the voicemail system.  Finally,  you can press the pound key to disconnect from the PBX.
